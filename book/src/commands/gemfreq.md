# GEMFREQ -- Word Frequency Within Gem Segments

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-27 10:45 EDT

## Purpose

Computes word frequency restricted to utterances inside `@G:`-labeled
gem segments. `gemfreq` is a CLAN compatibility alias for the more
general [`freq --gem`](freq.md). The behavior is identical to running
`freq` with a required `--gem` filter; the alias exists so legacy
CLAN scripts that invoke `gemfreq` directly keep working.

The legacy CLAN manual entry is at
[GEMFREQ](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html#_Toc220409273).

## Usage

`gemfreq` requires the `--gem`/`-g` option; there is no implicit
"all gems" mode (unlike `freq`, where `--gem` is optional).

```bash
chatter clan gemfreq --gem story file.cha
chatter clan gemfreq -g story file.cha               # short form
chatter clan gemfreq --gem story --gem retell file.cha   # multiple gems
```

## Options

The flag set is identical to [`freq`](freq.md): `--mor`,
`--speaker` / `--exclude-speaker`, `--include-word` / `--exclude-word`,
`--exclude-gem`, `--range`, `--per-file`, `--include-retracings`,
`--format`, plus the universal verbosity / TUI / theme flags.

The only behavioral difference is that `gemfreq` rejects invocations
without at least one `--gem`/`-g` argument; `freq` treats `--gem`
as an optional restriction.

For full per-flag descriptions, output formats, word-normalization
rules, and CLAN-equivalence tables, see [freq.md](freq.md).

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

Authoritative enumeration of every CLAN `gemfreq` flag. Sources:

* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/gemfreq.cpp`: `usage()`.
* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/cutt.cpp`: `mainusage()` GEMFREQ branches.
* `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs`: chatter's rewriter.
* chatter's `gemfreq` is wired as an alias for
  `freq --gem`, the clap field surface is FREQ's.

### GEMFREQ-specific `+`-flags (from `gemfreq.cpp::usage`)

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+e` | Do not output nested gems along with the matched one |, | Missing | Gem-nesting handling. |
| `+g` (no S) | Marker tier should contain all words specified by `+s` |, | Missing | EVAL-style `+g` overload. |
| `+n` | Each gem terminated by the next `@G` |, | Missing | Gem-termination semantic switch. |
| `+o` | Sort output by descending frequency | (default) | Done | CLAN: `gemfreq.cpp:260` (`isSort = TRUE; no_arg_option(f)`). chatter's `gemfreq` (compatibility alias for `freq --gem`) already sorts by descending frequency by default, so `+o` is semantically a no-op. Per-GEMFREQ rewriter arm in `clan_args.rs` consumes-and-drops `+o` so it doesn't fall through to the positional `<PATH>` slot. |
| `+wS` / `+w@S` | Search for word `S` (or words in file `@S`) | `--include-word` | Partial | File-list form missing. |
| `-wS` | Exclude word `S` | `--exclude-word` | Done | CLAN: `gemfreq.cpp:296` (`case 'w': *(f-1) = 's'` rewrites the flag from `w` to `s` then calls `maingetflag`, so CLAN's `-wS` is the standard exclude-word semantic). Per-GEMFREQ rewriter arm in `clan_args.rs` routes `-wS` → `--exclude-word S` to match CLAN's polarity. Without this arm, chatter's clap `-w` short (`--include-word`) would silently mis-route the flag to include-word (OPPOSITE polarity from CLAN). Pinned by `gemfreq_minus_w_routes_to_exclude_word`. |
| `+yN` | Display whole tier unchanged (1) or cleaned up (0) |, | Missing | |
| `+dN` | `onlydata` output-detail level (manual lists `+d0` legal CHAT, `+d1` with line/file/`@ID` info) |, | Missing | `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/gemfreq.cpp` has no local `case 'd'`; consumption is entirely via the shared `maingetflag` path at `cutt.cpp:9382` (empty per-program body at `cutt.cpp:9471`) setting the `onlydata` level. chatter's `gemfreq` clap surface has no `--display-mode` consumer. Per-GEMFREQ rewriter arm in `clan_args.rs` passes the token through so clap reports the literal `+dN` argument rather than the misleading `--display-mode` rewrite. |

### Audit summary

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| Done | 6 |
| Partial | 2 |
| Rewriter only | 4 |
| Missing | 9 |

The `+g` / `+n` / `+yN` cluster are GEMFREQ's most distinctive
gaps: they control gem-segment scoping (nested gems, termination
semantic, raw-vs-cleaned text output) and have no chatter analog.
Most users will be served by the simple `gemfreq --gem LABEL`
form already wired through the FREQ alias.

## Display Modes (`+dN` / `--display-mode N`), DRAFT, awaiting PI review

> **Status: drafted from CLAN manual; not yet implemented.** Rewriter
> at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:101` translates
> `+dN` → `--display-mode N`; no `clap` field consumes it today.
> Drafted from CLAN manual §7.14 (`Unique Options`, GEMFREQ) for
> PI review.
>
> **Important divergence flag.** In CLAN, GEMFREQ's `+d` table is
> identical to **GEM's** (legal CHAT format + annotation), not
> identical to **FREQ's** (output format selector with 9 values).
> chatter's gemfreq currently inherits the freq common-args, so any
> `--display-mode N` implementation has to decide which semantics
> apply, and that's worth pulling apart before clap touches it.

| N | CLAN behavior (verbatim from manual) |
|---|---|
| `+d0` | "Produces simple output that is in legal chat format." |
| `+d1` | "Adds information to the legal chat output regarding file names, line numbers, and `@ID` codes." |

### Open questions for PI review

1. GEMFREQ in CLAN borrows GEM's `+d`, not FREQ's. Should chatter
   follow CLAN's CLAN-faithful behavior (treat `--display-mode 0` as
   the GEM-style legal-CHAT output), or should the chatter `gemfreq`
   inherit FREQ's `--display-mode` table (since they share
   common-args)?
2. If we honor CLAN's split, `gemfreq` is the *only* analyze command
   whose `+d` differs from its lexically-similar parent. That feels
   like a CLAN historical accident worth deviating from in
   chatter, but it's a deviation, not a faithful port.

## When to use `gemfreq` vs `freq --gem`

Functionally these are the same call. Pick `gemfreq` when:

- you are porting a legacy CLAN script that invokes `gemfreq` and want
  byte-compatible-looking command lines, or
- you want the command name to surface "gem-restricted" intent
  immediately to readers of the script.

Pick `freq --gem story` when:

- you are writing new scripts that may need to mix gem-restricted and
  unrestricted analysis under the same command, or
- you want to omit `--gem` to fall back to whole-file frequency.

## Reference

Implementation: `Gemfreq` is a separate `clap` subcommand variant in
the `ClanCommands` enum (not a `#[command(alias = "...")]`); the
required `--gem` constraint is enforced via a clap `ArgGroup` with
`required(true)`. The dispatcher at
`crates/talkbank-cli/src/commands/clan/compatibility.rs::96` routes
the parsed arguments to `run_analysis_and_print` with
`AnalysisCommandName::Freq`, so behavior past the parse boundary is
identical to a `freq --gem …` invocation. See [freq.md](freq.md) for
the complete reference.
