# GEM -- Extract Gem Segments

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-26 11:24 EDT

## Purpose

Extracts material within gem boundaries. The legacy manual gives `GEM` a dedicated section; in `talkbank-clan`, it extracts utterances and their dependent tiers that fall within `@Bg`/`@Eg` gem boundaries, producing a new CHAT file containing only the gem-scoped content.

See the [CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html#_Toc220409206) for the original GEM command specification.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan gem file.cha
chatter clan gem --gem story file.cha
```

## CLAN Equivalence

| CLAN command                    | Rust equivalent                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `gem file.cha`                  | `chatter clan gem file.cha`                |
| `gem +g"story" file.cha`        | `chatter clan gem --gem story file.cha`    |

## Options

| Option | CLAN Flag | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `--gem <LABEL>` | `+g"label"` | Extract only gem segments matching this label |

Without `--gem`, all gem segments in the file are extracted.

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

GEM is a **transform** (input CHAT → output CHAT containing only
gem segments). Sources: `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/gem.cpp::usage`,
`crates/talkbank-clan/src/transforms/gem.rs`.

### GEM-specific `+`-flags (from `gem.cpp::usage`)

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+a` | Output all tiers but the gems themselves (default: gem-only) |, | Missing | Inverse extraction mode. |
| `+b` | Output beg-bullet value of first speaker utterance in gem |, | Missing | Bullet-output addition. |
| `+e` | Do not output nested gems with the matched one |, | Missing | Same `+e` semantic as in GEMFREQ. |
| `+g` (no S) | Marker tier should contain all words specified by `+s` |, | Missing | EVAL-style `+g` overload. |
| `+gS` | Restrict to gem labelled `S` | `--gem <LABEL>` | Done | |
| `+n` | Each gem terminated by next `@G` |, | Missing | Same gem-termination semantic as in EVAL/COREELEX/FLUCALC. |
| `+dN` | Output-format variants (from manual §7.13) |, | Missing | Hybrid consumption per `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/gem.cpp:130`: `+d2` is a local override (`onlySelectedBG_EGHeaders = TRUE`); every other `+dN` value delegates to `maingetflag` at `cutt.cpp:9382` (empty per-program body at `cutt.cpp:9470`) setting the shared `onlydata` output-detail level. chatter has neither consumer. Per-GEM rewriter arm in `clan_args.rs` passes the token through so clap reports the literal `+dN` argument rather than the misleading `--display-mode` rewrite. |

### Audit summary

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| Done | 1 |
| Rewriter only | 3 |
| Missing | 7 |

GEM's command-specific gaps overlap heavily with GEMFREQ's: both
the `+e` nested-gem and `+n` termination toggles are missing in
both. A shared "gem-segment scoping" config could close both
commands' gaps at once; filed as a Phase 1.7 follow-up.

## Display Modes (`+dN` / `--display-mode N`), DRAFT, awaiting PI review

> **Status: drafted from CLAN manual; not yet implemented.** Rewriter
> at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:101` translates
> `+dN` → `--display-mode N`; no `clap` field consumes it today.
> Drafted from CLAN manual §7.13 (GEM, in-section `+d` note) for
> PI review.

| N | CLAN behavior (verbatim from manual) |
|---|---|
| `+d0` | "Produces simple output that is in legal chat format." |
| `+d1` | "Adds information to the legal chat output regarding file names, line numbers, and `@ID` codes." |

### Open questions for PI review

1. GEM is a transform command in chatter (writes a new CHAT file).
   `+d0` "legal CHAT format" *is* GEM's default behavior in chatter
, so `--display-mode 0` would be a no-op. Should the flag error
   on `--display-mode 0` (already-default), accept it silently, or
   simply not be plumbed for GEM at all?
2. `+d1` adds filenames/line numbers/@ID codes, that's annotation
   metadata not normally in a CHAT file. Map to a separate
   `--annotate` boolean rather than `--display-mode 1`?

## Behavior

The transform scans for `@Bg:` (begin gem) and `@Eg:` (end gem) header boundaries. All utterances between a matching `@Bg`/`@Eg` pair are included in the output, along with their dependent tiers. The gem boundary headers themselves are preserved. File-level headers and participant metadata are carried through unchanged.

## Differences from CLAN

- Gem boundary detection operates on parsed `Header` variants from the AST rather than raw text line matching for `@BG:`/`@EG:`.
- Handles both `@Bg:`/`@Eg:` (mixed case) and `@BG:`/`@EG:` (uppercase).
- Without `--gem` filter, extracts all gem segments. With `--gem`, extracts only matching labels.
