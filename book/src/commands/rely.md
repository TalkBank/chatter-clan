# RELY, Inter-Rater Reliability (Cohen's Kappa)

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 09:48 EDT

## Purpose

Compares two parallel CHAT files for coder agreement. The legacy manual gives `RELY` five functions: coder agreement, Cohen's kappa, student-vs-master evaluation, rough transcript overlap on the main line, and selective dependent-tier merging.

The current `talkbank-clan` implementation focuses on the coding-tier comparison use case: it compares coded data on a specified dependent tier (default `%cod`) across two files to compute per-code agreement statistics, overall agreement percentage, and Cohen's kappa coefficient.

See the [CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html#_Toc220409232) for the original RELY command specification.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan rely file1.cha file2.cha
chatter clan rely file1.cha file2.cha --tier spa
```

## Algorithm

1. Parse both input files and extract codes per utterance from the specified tier
2. Align utterances by position (index)
3. For each aligned pair, count per-code agreements (minimum of the two counts for each code in that utterance)
4. Compute overall observed agreement (Po) and expected agreement (Pe) for Cohen's kappa: `k = (Po - Pe) / (1 - Pe)`

## Options (chatter-native)

| Option | CLAN flag | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `--tier <name>` | `+t%X` (rewriter target) | Tier label to compare (default: `cod`) |
| `--format <fmt>` | -- | Output format: clan (default), text, json, csv |

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

RELY is a **paired-file analysis** (control + second file). The
flag set is largely inherited; the command-specific flags govern
which aspects of the comparison are computed.

### RELY-specific `+`-flags (from `rely.cpp::usage`)

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+a` | Add tiers from second file to first (control) file |, | Missing | Tier-merging mode (not a kappa computation). |
| `+b` | Include BULLETS in string comparison |, | Missing | Bullets are CHAT-format media-link markers. |
| `+c` | Do not compare data on non-selected tier |, | Missing | |
| `+c1` | Compare only main part of code (`$COD:EX` → just `$COD`) |, | Missing | Code-prefix granularity. |
| `+d` | Compute percentage-agreement coefficient |, | Rewriter only | Multi-dispatch (see Display Modes section). |
| `+dmN` | Compute student correctness (m1 = first is control, m2 = second is control) |, | Rewriter only | |
| `+dN` | Compute Cohen's kappa with `N` possible categories |, | Rewriter only | chatter computes kappa always; `N` (category count) is not user-specifiable. |
| `+u` | Compute kappa across all pairs of files |, | Missing | |
| `+m` | Merge files and place error flags in output |, | Missing | |

### Audit summary

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| Done | 4 |
| Partial | 0 |
| Rewriter only | 4 |
| Missing | 11 |

RELY has the most **fragmented `+d`** semantics of any CLAN
command: `+d` (percentage), `+dmN` (student correctness), `+dN`
(numeric kappa) all use the same flag letter with different
shapes. Researchers expecting CLAN's per-flag-shape behavior need
the multi-dispatch wired through `--display-mode`.

## Display Modes (`+dN` / `--display-mode N`), DRAFT, awaiting PI review

> **Status: drafted from CLAN manual; not yet implemented.** Rewriter
> at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:101` translates
> `+dN` → `--display-mode N`; no `clap` field consumes it today.
> Drafted from CLAN manual §7.24.1 (`Unique Options`, RELY) for
> PI review. **RELY's `+d` is a multi-dispatch flag** with three
> distinct forms, bare, `+dmN`, and `+dN` (numeric kappa), that
> can't all fit into a single scalar `--display-mode N`.

| Form | CLAN behavior (verbatim from manual) |
|---|---|
| `+d` (bare) | "Compute percentage agreement. By default, this is based only on the main line. To compute percentage agreement on a dependent tier, such as `%cod`, you should add the `-t*` switch to exclude the main line and then use `+t%cod` to include just this dependent tier." |
| `+dmN` | "Compute student correctness. (`+dm1`, first file is control, `+dm2` second file is control.)" |
| `+dN` | "Compute Cohen's kappa coefficient, where N is the number of categories." |

### Open questions for PI review

1. The three forms are *modes*, not numeric levels. Should chatter
   expose them as an enum (`--mode percentage|student|kappa`) with a
   separate `--categories N` for the kappa case, rather than try to
   overload `--display-mode`?
2. `+dN` collides with the universal `--display-mode N` shape used by
   FREQ/KWAL/etc. The rewriter at clan_args.rs:101 doesn't currently
   distinguish RELY's `+dN` from FREQ's `+dN`. Resolving this
   requires the rewriter to be subcommand-aware (similar to how
   `+g1..+g5` are already CHECK-aware).
3. `+dmN` is even more specific, small-N integer that picks which
   file is the control. The current rewriter has no `+dm` case;
   adding it requires explicit per-command branching.

## Output

- Per-code agreement statistics (count in each file, agreed count, agreement percentage)
- Overall agreement percentage
- Cohen's kappa coefficient

## Differences from CLAN

- RELY requires two-file input and does not use the standard `AnalysisCommand` trait; it is invoked directly
- **Manual intent**: The legacy manual gives special semantics for coding tiers such as `%cod` and `%spa`, and documents `+c1` as comparing only the main part of a colon-delimited code.
- Code extraction for `%cod` now uses a clan-local semantic `%cod` item layer derived from the parsed AST
- **Selector handling**: `%cod` selectors such as `<w4>` and `<w4-5>` are preserved as item scope, not counted as compared code values.
- **Scope reduction**: The current implementation does not yet cover all five legacy `RELY` functions described in the manual, and it does not yet implement the documented `+c1` colon-prefix comparison mode.
- Output supports text, JSON, and CSV formats
- **Golden test parity**: Verified against CLAN C binary output
