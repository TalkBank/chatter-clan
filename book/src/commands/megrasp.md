# MEGRASP -- Grammar Relation Parsing (deliberately not implemented)

**Status:** Reference -- stub command
**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 13:14 EDT

## Purpose

In legacy CLAN, `megrasp` adds `%gra` (grammatical relation) tiers
to CHAT files. It builds dependency-style head/relation labels on top
of an existing `%mor` tier produced by [`mor`](mor.md), using the
MEGRASP rule engine.

This project does **not** implement `megrasp`. Like its `%mor`
counterpart, the legacy hand-coded grammar rules are replaced by
neural inference. The CHAT data model uses UD-style dependency
relations on `%gra`, which Stanza emits directly alongside `%mor`.

## What to use instead

Use the upstream **batchalign3** morphotag pipeline. It produces
`%mor` and `%gra` tiers from a single Stanza pass, with UD-style
relations (`NSUBJ`, `OBJ`, `ROOT`, etc.) instead of CLAN's GRASP
labels. The mapping layer is documented in the `batchalign3`
project's morphosyntax reference.

```bash
batchalign3 morphotag corpus/  # emits %mor + %gra together
```

## Behavior

Invoking `chatter clan megrasp` prints an error directing users to
batchalign and exits with a non-zero status. No CHAT files are
modified.

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

**Exempt**: see [MOR](mor.md#clan--flag-coverage-audit) for the
shared MOR-pipeline policy: chatter does not consume CLAN's
`+`-flags for any command in this family. CLAN's own usage text
documents the legacy flag surface; chatter emits a refusal that
points users to batchalign.
