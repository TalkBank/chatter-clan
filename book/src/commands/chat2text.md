# CHAT2TEXT, CHAT to Plain Text

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 13:32 EDT

## Purpose

Converts CHAT files into plain text lines suitable for downstream text analysis. The legacy manual describes `CHAT2TEXT` as converting a CHAT file to text lines for concordance programs such as AntConc, and says it is implemented as an alias of `FLO` with `+cr +t*`.

`talkbank-clan` implements the same broad intent directly by extracting plain spoken text from the parsed CHAT AST.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan chat2text file.cha
chatter clan chat2text --include-speaker file.cha
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--include-speaker` | Prefix each line with speaker code (e.g., "CHI: hello world") |

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

CHAT2TEXT has **no dedicated `.cpp`** in CLAN's source tree,
the manual describes it as an alias for `flo +cr +t*`. chatter
exposes it as a first-class converter with a chatter-only
`--include-speaker` toggle (CLAN's `+cr` strips speaker codes;
chatter's default also strips, with `--include-speaker` as the
opt-in).

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| _(none; aliased to `flo +cr +t*`)_ |, | default plain-text extraction | Done |

Audit summary: 1 Done, 0 Missing. Chatter's `--include-speaker`
is a UI nicety with no direct CLAN counterpart.

## Output

Plain text with one utterance per line. All CHAT annotations are stripped:
- Bracketed annotations (`[/]`, `[: replacement]`, `[*]`)
- Timing bullets
- Terminators (`.`, `?`, `!`)
- Fillers (`&-um`), fragments (`&+fr`), events (`&=laughs`)
- Untranscribed markers (`xxx`, `yyy`, `www`)
- Omitted words (`0word`)

## Differences from CLAN

- **Manual intent**: the
  [CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html) does have a
  dedicated `CHAT2TEXT` section, and it describes the command as a
  `FLO`-based alias rather than as a separate semantic engine.
- Uses AST-based content extraction for reliable annotation stripping.
- Does not model the legacy implementation literally as `flo +cr +t*`; it performs the plain-text extraction directly.
