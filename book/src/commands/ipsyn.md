# IPSYN -- Index of Productive Syntax

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-26 10:20 EDT

## Purpose

Computes a syntactic complexity score by awarding points for distinct syntactic structures observed in a child's utterances. Each structure type (rule) can earn at most 2 points -- one per distinct utterance in which the structure appears. The total across all rules yields the IPSyn score.

See the [CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html#_Toc220409276) for the original IPSYN command specification.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan ipsyn file.cha
chatter clan ipsyn --speaker CHI file.cha
chatter clan ipsyn --rules ipsyn.rules file.cha
chatter clan ipsyn --max-utterances 100 file.cha
```

## Options (chatter-native)

| Option | CLAN flag | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `--speaker <CODE>` | `+t*CHI` (or `+tCHI`) | Include speaker |
| `--exclude-speaker <CODE>` | `-t*CHI` (or `-tCHI`) | Exclude speaker |
| `--rules <PATH>` | `+lF` | Custom IPSYN rules file |
| `--max-utterances <N>` | `+cN` | Maximum utterances to analyze (default: 100) |
| `--gem <LABEL>` | `+g"label"` | Restrict to gem segment |
| `--range <START-END>` | `+z25-125` | Utterance range |
| `--id-filter <PATTERN>` | `+t@ID="..."` | Filter by @ID pattern |
| `--include-retracings` | `+r6` | Include retraced words in counting |
| `--format <FMT>` | -- | Output format: clan (default), text, json, csv |

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

Authoritative enumeration of every CLAN `ipsyn` flag. Sources:

* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/ipsyn.cpp`: `usage()`.
* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/cutt.cpp`: `mainusage()` IPSYN branches.
* `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs`: chatter's rewriter.
* `crates/talkbank-cli/src/cli/args/clan_commands.rs::Ipsyn` plus
  `clan_common.rs::CommonAnalysisArgs`.

(Status legend: same as [FREQ](./freq.md#status-legend).)

IPSYN is a **required-flag refusal** command in chatter, same
refusal byte-parity as EVAL/KIDEVAL/DSS/SUGAR. The rules file is
also required for non-default analysis.

### IPSYN-specific `+`-flags (from `ipsyn.cpp::usage`)

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+cN` | Analyse N complete unique utterances (default 100) | `--max-utterances N` | Done | Direct mapping; rewriter routes `+cN` → `--max-utterances N` for IPSYN (since the per-subcommand routing batch). |
| `+d` | Do not show file and line number where points are found |, | Missing | Per `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/ipsyn.cpp:3945`, CLAN sets `onlydata = atoi(getfarg(...)) + 1` (bounded by `OnlydataLimit`); `+d` → level 1. chatter has no `--only-data` flag. Per-IPSYN arm in `clan_args.rs` passes the token through so clap reports the literal `+d` argument rather than the misleading `--display-mode` rewrite. |
| `+d1` | Output in spreadsheet format |, | Missing | Same `onlydata` toggle as `+d` (CLAN: `+d1` → level 2). chatter not implemented; passthrough arm. |
| `+lF` | Specify IPSYN rules file name `F` | `--rules <PATH>` | Done | Direct mapping; rewriter routes `+lF` → `--rules F` for IPSYN (since the per-subcommand routing batch). |
| `+o` | Use the original rule set (100 utterances) |, | Missing | |
| `-sS` | Ignore `[+ ip]` / `[+ ipe]` postcodes | partial via `--exclude-word` | Partial | Different semantic, chatter filters by word, CLAN's IPSYN `-sS` skips postcoded utterances. |

### Audit summary

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| Done | 6 |
| Partial | 3 |
| Rewriter only | 2 |
| Missing | 7 |

IPSYN's two cleanest one-line follow-ups (rewriter routing of
`+cN` → `--max-utterances N` and `+lF` → `--rules F`) landed
together with the per-subcommand flag-routing batch
(commit 9d34a10b).

## Rule Categories

Rules are organized into four categories:

| Category | Code | Description | Example structures |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Noun Phrase | **N** | Noun phrase complexity | Two-word NP, article+noun, possessive |
| Verb Phrase | **V** | Verb phrase complexity | Copula, auxiliary, modal, infinitive |
| Question | **Q** | Question formation | Yes/no, wh-question, tag question |
| Sentence | **S** | Sentence structure | Conjoined, embedded, relative clause |

The full English IPSyn has ~56 rules. The built-in default set provides a representative subset.

## Algorithm

1. For each utterance, serialize the `%mor` tier to text
2. Match each rule pattern against the serialized `%mor` content
3. For each rule, record the first two distinct utterances that match (max 2 points per rule)
4. Sum all rule scores across categories
5. Report total score and per-category subtotals

### Scoring example

If rule N1 ("Two-word NP") matches in utterances 3 and 7, it earns 2 points. If it only matches in utterance 3, it earns 1 point. If it never matches, 0 points.

## Output

Per-speaker IPSyn total score with per-category subtotals (N, V, Q, S) and optional per-rule detail.

## Differences from CLAN

### Rule set

The built-in rule set is a simplified subset. For full 56-rule coverage, supply the official IPSYN rules file via `--rules`.

### Pattern matching

Uses substring-based matching on the serialized `%mor` tier text rather than structured POS/morpheme matching. This produces equivalent results for most patterns but may differ for edge cases involving complex morphological structures.

### Maximum utterances

Defaults to 100 (matching CLAN). Configurable via `--max-utterances`.

### Output formats

Supports text, JSON, and CSV. CLAN produces text only.

### Golden test parity

Verified against CLAN C binary output.
