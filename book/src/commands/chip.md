# CHIP -- Child/Parent Interaction Profile

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-26 11:43 EDT

## Purpose

Analyzes interaction patterns between a child speaker and their conversational partners. Categorizes successive utterance pairs to measure imitation, repetition, and overlap. CHIP is commonly used in child language research to quantify how much a child imitates or echoes their interlocutor.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan chip file.cha
chatter clan chip --speaker CHI file.cha
chatter clan chip --format json file.cha
```

## Options (chatter-native)

| Option | CLAN Flag | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `--speaker <CODE>` | `+t*CHI` (or `+tCHI`) | Include speaker |
| `--exclude-speaker <CODE>` | `-t*CHI` (or `-tCHI`) | Exclude speaker |
| `--gem <LABEL>` | `+g"label"` | Restrict to gem segment |
| `--range <START-END>` | `+z25-125` | Utterance range |
| `--id-filter <PATTERN>` | `+t@ID="..."` | Filter by @ID pattern |
| `--include-retracings` | `+r6` | Include retraced words in counting |
| `--format <FMT>` | -- | Output format: clan (default), text, json, csv |

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

Authoritative enumeration of every CLAN `chip` flag. Sources:

* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/chip.cpp`: `usage()`.
* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/cutt.cpp`: `mainusage()` CHIP branches.
* `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs`: chatter's rewriter.
* `crates/talkbank-cli/src/cli/args/clan_commands.rs::Chip` plus
  `clan_common.rs::CommonAnalysisArgs`.

### CHIP-specific `+`-flags (from `chip.cpp::usage`)

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+bS` | Speaker ID `S` is an adult |, | Missing | CHIP's role tagging, the partner-vs-child distinction is CHIP's whole purpose. |
| `+cS` | Speaker ID `S` is a child |, | Missing | |
| `+g` | Enable substitution option |, | Missing | Substitution coding. |
| `-hF` | File `F` has words to be excluded |, | Missing | Word-list exclusion. |
| `-nC` | Do not code `C: b` (adult), `c` (child), or `s` (asr/csr) responses |, | Missing | Response-type filter. |
| `+qN` | Set utterance window to `N` utterances before response |, | Missing | Context-window for response pairing. |
| `+wN` | Set minimum number of words on source utterance |, | Rewriter only | Collides with the inherited `+wN` context window (see KWAL). |
| `+xN` | Set minimum repetition index for coding |, | Missing | |
| `+dN` | Various display modes (full N table omitted here) |, | Missing | CHIP has no local `case 'd'`; consumption is via the shared `maingetflag` path at `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/cutt.cpp:9382` with non-empty per-program body at `cutt.cpp:9427` (`onlydata == 2` → `puredata = 0`; CLAN_SRV rejects `onlydata == 3`). Same `onlydata`-level semantic as the empty-body commands. chatter has no `--display-mode` consumer for CHIP. Per-CHIP rewriter arm in `clan_args.rs` passes the token through. |

### Audit summary

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| Done | 5 |
| Partial | 1 |
| Rewriter only | 5 |
| Missing | 13 |

CHIP's largest gap is the **adult/child speaker-role tagging**
(`+bS` / `+cS`), without these, CHIP cannot determine which
utterance pair is being analysed (target child speaking, partner
speaking, both). chatter's CHIP today processes pairs but with
chatter-side heuristics; CLAN-compatible interaction profiling
requires the explicit role tags. The collision between CHIP's
`+wN` (source minimum-word count) and the inherited `+wN`
(context window from KWAL) is a documented overload trap.

## Display Modes (`+dN` / `--display-mode N`), DRAFT, awaiting PI review

> **Status: drafted from CLAN manual; not yet implemented.** The
> rewriter at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:101` translates
> `+dN` → `--display-mode N`, but no `clap` field consumes that token
> today. Drafted from CLAN manual §7.4.5 (`Unique Options`, CHIP) for
> PI review.

| N | CLAN behavior (verbatim from manual) |
|---|---|
| `+d` (no number) | "Using `+d` with no further number outputs only coding tiers, which are useful for iterative analyses." |
| `+d1` | "Using `+d1` outputs only summary statistics, which can then be sent to a statistical program." |

### Open questions for PI review

1. CHIP's `+d` shape (coding-tier-only vs summary-only) is orthogonal
   to the FREQ/KWAL/MLU shape (output format selectors). Should the
   `--display-mode` enum's variants be CHIP-specific
   (`coding-tiers` / `summary`) or share a name space with FREQ's
   variants?
2. "Useful for iterative analyses" implies the coding-tier output is
   intended to be piped to another `chatter clan` command. Should
   chatter prefer making this the *default* JSON output shape, with
   `--display-mode summary` collapsing to just the matrix?

## Interaction Categories

For each adjacent utterance pair (speaker A followed by speaker B):

| Category | Condition |
|----------|-----------|
| **Exact repetition** | B's words are identical to A's (order-independent) |
| **Overlap** | B shares >= 50% of words with A (smaller unique-word set as denominator) |
| **No overlap** | B shares < 50% of words with A |

Only cross-speaker adjacency is considered; consecutive utterances by the same speaker do not produce interaction records. Adjacency state is reset at file boundaries.

## Output

**36-measure matrix format** structurally matching CLAN:

- ADU (adult) / CHI (child) / ASR (adult-speech-related) / CSR (child-speech-related) columns
- Per directed speaker pair (MOT->CHI is distinct from CHI->MOT)
- Counts and percentages for each interaction category
- Grand totals across all pairs

**Current implementation status (2026-05-12):** the matrix header,
row labels, and ADU/CHI/ASR/CSR column layout are implemented and
written by `chip.rs:246-260`. The actual *measure values* are
written as zeros, `chip.rs:253` carries a comment "currently all
zeros, full computation not yet implemented." So the structural
parity is in place but the analytical numbers are not yet
computed. See §Golden test parity below for the consequence.

### Echo behavior

When displaying matched utterances, CHIP echoes:
- Main tier text
- `%mor` tier (if present)

It does **not** echo `%gra` tiers, matching CLAN's behavior.

## Differences from CLAN

### Matrix format

Uses the exact **36-measure matrix format** with ADU/CHI/ASR/CSR columns. Header, row labels, and column structure match CLAN character-for-character; per §Output, the measure-value cells are currently emitted as zeros pending full implementation.

### Echo content

Echoes main tier + `%mor` only (not `%gra` tiers), matching CLAN.

### Word identification

Uses AST-based `is_countable_word()` instead of CLAN's string-prefix matching. Overlap comparison operates on parsed word content, not raw text.

### Output formats

Supports text, JSON, and CSV. CLAN produces text only.

### Golden test parity

No CHIP-specific golden tests are currently checked in (`rg
'chip_golden|chip.*golden'` returns nothing in `tests/` and
`crates/talkbank-clan/`). The previous "100% parity" claim was
incorrect given the stub measure values described above. Once the
36 measures are computed, golden tests should be added against a
real CLAN CHIP run.
