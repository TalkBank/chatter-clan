# REPEAT -- Mark Utterances Containing Revisions

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 12:57 EDT

## Purpose

Reimplements CLAN's `repeat` command, which adds a `[+ rep]` postcode to utterances from a target speaker that contain revision markers. Only utterances that do not already have `[+ rep]` are modified.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan repeat --speaker CHI file.cha
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--speaker` | speaker code | *(required)* | Target speaker to process. Only utterances from this speaker are checked. |

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

REPEAT is a **transform**. Sources:
`OSX-CLAN/src/clan/repeat.cpp::usage`,
`crates/talkbank-clan/src/transforms/repeat.rs`.

### REPEAT-specific `+`-flags (from `repeat.cpp::usage`)

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+tS` | Specify target speaker `S` | `--speaker S` | Done | Direct mapping. The clap field is *required*, matching CLAN's behaviour (no implicit "all speakers" mode). |

### Audit summary

| Bucket | Count |

REPEAT has a single command-specific flag, mapped one-to-one.
Parity is clean. The revision-marker classifier
(`is_revision_kind`) is documented above and tracks CLAN's
default markers verbatim.

## Revision Markers Detected

Per `is_revision_kind()` at
`crates/talkbank-clan/src/transforms/repeat.rs:81-87`, three of the
four `RetraceKind` variants trigger `[+ rep]`:

- `[//]`: full retrace (`RetraceKind::Full`)
- `[///]`: multiple retracing (`RetraceKind::Multiple`)
- `[/-]`: reformulation (`RetraceKind::Reformulation`)

Note: Simple partial repetition (`[/]`, `RetraceKind::Partial`)
does **not** trigger the `[+ rep]` marker, that's the
"non-revision" case. (Earlier versions of this doc listed a `[/?]`
"uncertain retracing" marker as the fourth case; there is no such
marker, the grammar has exactly four retrace tokens, all listed
above and at `book/src/chat-format/retraces.md`.)

## Behavior

For each utterance from the target speaker, the transform checks whether the main-tier content contains any revision markers. If revision markers are found and the utterance does not already have a `[+ rep]` postcode, one is appended.

Utterances from other speakers are left unchanged.

## Differences from CLAN

- Operates on AST rather than raw text.
- Uses the framework transform pipeline (parse -> transform -> serialize -> write).
