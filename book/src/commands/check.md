# CHECK, CHAT File Validation

**Status:** Current
**Last modified:** 2026-05-29 17:32 EDT

CHECK validates CHAT files for structural correctness, checking headers, tier
formatting, bracket matching, bullet consistency, speaker declarations, and more.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan check file.cha
chatter clan check +c0 file.cha          # Full bullet check
chatter clan check +e file.cha           # List all error numbers
chatter clan check +e6 file.cha          # Only report error 6
chatter clan check -e6 file.cha          # Exclude error 6
chatter clan check +g2 file.cha          # Check CHI has Target_Child
chatter clan check +g5 file.cha          # Check for unused speakers
chatter clan check +u file.cha           # Check UD features on %mor
```

## Options

| CLAN flag | Modern flag | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `+c0` | `--bullets 0` | Full bullet consistency check |
| `+c1` | `--bullets 1` | Check for missing bullets only |
| `+e` | `--list-errors` | List all 161 error numbers and exit |
| `+eN` | `--error N` | Only report error number N (repeatable) |
| `-eN` | `--exclude-error N` | Exclude error number N (repeatable) |
| `+g1` | *(no-op)* | Prosodic delimiters (always recognized) |
| `+g2` | `--check-target` | Verify CHI has Target_Child role |
| `+g3` | *(partial)* | Word detail checks (via parser) |
| `+g4` | `--check-id` | Check for missing @ID tiers (on by default) |
| `+g5` | `--check-unused` | Check for unused speakers |
| `+u` | `--check-ud` | Validate UD features on %mor tier |

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

CHECK is a **validator**: and the audit shape differs from
every other command by design. Per the
`chatter-clan-check-is-exception` memory rule (saved 2026-05-21):

> chatter `check` deliberately improves on CLAN's CHECK; track
> divergences as documented improvements, not regressions. Use
> CLAN check as a find-missing-rules oracle, not a byte-level
> reference.

The Options table above is therefore the **authoritative
mapping** for chatter's CHECK surface, not a parity scorecard.
Where CLAN's flag has a chatter equivalent, the row says so.
Where CLAN's behaviour is a documented improvement target (e.g.
161 named error codes vs CLAN's smaller fixed set), chatter
leads. Where chatter validates something CLAN does not (e.g.
UD-grade `%mor` features, expansive header-coherence checks),
those validations are chatter extensions with no CLAN
counterpart.

### Audit summary (CHECK is exempt from parity buckets)

CHECK is exempted from the "Done / Partial / Rewriter only /
Missing" buckets used elsewhere in this catalog. The CLAN-bug
divergence ledger
([framework.md](../divergences/framework.md)) is the canonical
home for CHECK-specific divergences when chatter improves on
the legacy behaviour.

The one CLAN `+`-flag explicitly **not** mapped here is `+dN`
warning-suppression (see Display Modes section below), which is
semantically distinct from FREQ/KWAL/COMBO's `+d` output-format
selector and would need its own warning-tagging
infrastructure. CHECK has no local `case 'd'`; consumption is via
the shared `maingetflag` path at `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/cutt.cpp:9382`
with the CHECK-specific per-program body at `cutt.cpp:9422`
(`onlydata == 3` → `puredata = 2`; else `puredata = 0`), and an
additional short-circuit at `check.cpp:852` (`check_adderror`
returns early when `onlydata == 0 || 3`, skipping the error).
chatter's per-CHECK passthrough arm in `clan_args.rs` keeps
`+d`/`+dN` literal so clap names the actual flag rather than the
catch-all's misleading `--display-mode` rewrite.

## Display Modes (`+dN` / `--display-mode N`), DRAFT, awaiting PI review

> **Status: drafted from CLAN manual; not yet implemented.** Rewriter
> at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:101` translates
> `+dN` → `--display-mode N`; no `clap` field consumes it today.
> Drafted from CLAN manual §7.3.5 (`Unique Options`, CHECK) for
> PI review. Note: CHECK's `+d` is **warning-suppression**, not output
> formatting, semantically very different from FREQ/KWAL/COMBO's `+d`.

| N | CLAN behavior (verbatim from manual) |
|---|---|
| `+d` (no number) | "Attempts to suppress repeated warnings of the same type." |
| `+d1` | "Suppress ALL repeated warnings of the same type." |

### Open questions for PI review

1. CHECK's `+d` shape is orthogonal to the other commands'
   `--display-mode`. Mapping CHECK's `+d` to `--suppress-repeats`
   (boolean) or `--max-per-error N` (numeric) would be more honest
   than overloading `--display-mode`.
2. The main `chatter validate` command already exposes
   `--max-errors N` (stop after N errors *total*, across files).
   That's different from CLAN's "suppress repeats of the same type"
   semantics. Should `--display-mode 1` for CHECK be a new flag, or a
   variant of `--max-errors`?
3. Both `+d` and `+d1` are about suppression, the manual text doesn't
   distinguish their behaviors clearly. "Attempts to suppress"
   (`+d`) vs "Suppress ALL" (`+d1`), is the former rate-limited or
   heuristic? PI input needed on what CLAN actually does at runtime.

## Output Format

CHECK output matches CLAN's format:

```text
*** File "sample.cha": line 12.
*CHI:	doggy wanna play .
[E501] Illegal word character in 'wanna' (47)
```

Each error shows the file path and line number, the offending tier text, and the
error message with CHECK's numbered error code in parentheses.

Errors that don't map to a CHECK number show our internal code in brackets instead:

```text
*** File "sample.cha": line 5.
@Participants:	CHI Child
Missing role for CHI, expected format: CODE Name Role [E312]
```

## CHECK vs `chatter validate`

See [CHECK vs chatter validate](../divergences/check-vs-validate.md) for a
detailed comparison of these two validation tools.

## Differences from CLAN

- **Parsing**: Uses tree-sitter grammar instead of CLAN's character-by-character
  parser. More rigorous and consistent; catches structural errors that CHECK
  sometimes misses.
- **Error numbering**: CLAN CHECK uses flat numbers 1-161. We map our typed
  error codes to CHECK numbers where correspondence exists; unmapped errors
  get number 0.
- **Two-pass vs single-pass**: CLAN runs `check_OverAll` then `check_CheckRest`.
  Our parser combines both into a single streaming parse+validate pipeline.
- **depfile.cut**: CLAN reads `depfile.cut` for tier/code templates. We validate
  against the CHAT specification directly.
- **Bug fixes**: Several CHECK errors in the original are unreachable or
  duplicate (e.g., errors 51, 96 are commented out). We skip those.
- **`+g1`**: Always a no-op, our parser recognizes prosodic delimiters by default.
- **`+g3`**: Partially implemented through existing word validation.
