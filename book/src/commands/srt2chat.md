# SRT2CHAT -- SRT Subtitle to CHAT Conversion

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 13:40 EDT

## Purpose

Parses SRT (SubRip) subtitle files and converts them to CHAT format, mapping each subtitle block to an utterance with timing bullets derived from the SRT timestamps.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan srt2chat input.srt
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-l`, `--language` | `"eng"` | ISO 639 language code for the `@Languages` header |
| `-o`, `--output` | stdout | Output CHAT file path |

The speaker code (`"SPK"`) and corpus name (`"srt_corpus"`) in
`@ID` headers are both hardcoded at
`crates/talkbank-clan/src/converters/srt2chat.rs:152`; there are
no CLI flags to override them. Same pattern as the other
converters in this directory.

## Input Format

SRT files consist of numbered blocks separated by blank lines:

```text
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello world

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,800
How are you
```

Timestamps use `HH:MM:SS,mmm` format (both comma and period separators are accepted). Multi-line subtitle text within a block is joined with spaces.

## Output

A well-formed CHAT file where each SRT subtitle block becomes a timed utterance. Timing bullets are derived from the SRT timestamps (converted to milliseconds). All utterances are assigned to the configured speaker code.

## Differences from CLAN

- Uses typed AST for CHAT generation
- Produces valid, well-formed CHAT output
- Accepts both comma and period as millisecond separators in timestamps

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

SRT2CHAT is a **converter**: input SRT subtitles, output CHAT.
Sources: `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/Srt2Chat.cpp::usage`,
`crates/talkbank-clan/src/converters/srt2chat.rs`.

CLAN's `Srt2Chat.cpp::usage` documents **no command-specific
`+`-flags**. Byte-parity complete for the documented surface.
