# POST -- POS Disambiguation (deliberately not implemented)

**Status:** Reference -- stub command
**Last updated:** 2026-05-22 13:14 EDT

## Purpose

In legacy CLAN, `post` disambiguates the multiple part-of-speech
candidates that `mor` emits on a `%mor` tier, choosing the most
likely category for each token based on a trained model and a
context-sensitive rule database.

This project does **not** implement `post`. It is part of the legacy
CLAN MOR/POST grammar pipeline ([see `mor`](mor.md)) and depends on
the same lexicon and rule artifacts that we deliberately do not port.

## What to use instead

Use the upstream **batchalign3** morphotag pipeline. Stanza's neural
models produce a single disambiguated POS per token at inference
time, so a separate post-pass is not needed.

## Behavior

Invoking `chatter clan post` prints an error and exits non-zero. No
CHAT files are modified.

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

**Exempt**: see [MOR](mor.md#clan--flag-coverage-audit) for the
shared MOR-pipeline policy: chatter does not consume CLAN's
`+`-flags for any command in this family. CLAN's own usage text
documents the legacy flag surface; chatter emits a refusal that
points users to batchalign.
